### API Endpoint
The application provides a single API endpoint:

This endpoint accepts a URL as a query parameter and processes it. The response will be in JSON format, containing the status and any relevant data.
### Example Request
You can test the endpoint using a tool like `curl` or Postman:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/process?url=https://stratechery.com/"
```
### Response
The response will be a JSON object. For example:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "message": "URL processed successfully"
  }
}
```
